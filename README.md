Wright State University Bioinformatics Research Group PICNIC revision

The WSU BiRG PICNIC revision based on Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's Predicting Integral Copy Numbers In Cancer (PICNIC; URL: http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Software/PICNIC/ as of May 2013). Please see the file "sanger_distributed_read_me.txt" for more details and licensing information.

From the initial commitment of the PICNIC code to this repository, steps 1 and 2 in the "Running PICNIC" section of the "sanger_distributed_read_me.txt" file have already been taken. They do not need to be redone for the PICNIC code to work.

NB: This repository does not and should never include any required Affymetrix-proprietary SNP6 library files.
